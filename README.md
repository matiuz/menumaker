Eclipse RCP project to create and print a restaurant menu page. Based on EMF models, it requires PostgreSQL database.

User can create menu categories and menu item with a name, a description and a price. Then with drag and drop support user can drag menu item to create and store a new menu.
Then, user can print the desired menu selecting style (fonts, colors etc...) and restaurant logo position.

The main features are:

1) User interface written in Java and designed with SWT Windows Builder.
2) Postgres database interface via JDBC driver.
3) Data modelling with EMF plugin.

TODO

1) Add more database supports (SQlite...).
2) Increase user functionality.
